Meet 4 
date:29/10/19,Tuesday
The progress that has happened till now was discussed ie
1)The feedback was successfully attached to small servo motor and can be easily attached to bigger one as well.
2)The use of background subtractor of Opencv was successfully done,though it was a little bit slow.
The further planned progress is 
1)Making a hardcoded background mask to apply for the background subtractor using visual background extractor algorithm(ViBE) to make object detection quicker.
2)Getting the Design ready for the turret using catia.
3)Using a object recognition algorithm to identify the right object(if more than one object is moving) and marking it for further detection and tracking.
